# Liver Cirrhosis Prediction

Liver cirrhosis is a serious health condition, particularly common in North America, and often associated with prolonged alcohol consumption. This project aims to predict the stage of liver cirrhosis in patients based on lifestyle factors and various health indicators.

## Objective

Liver cirrhosis progression can be classified into four stages:

1. **Stage 1**: Normal
2. **Stage 2**: Fatty Liver
3. **Stage 3**: Liver Fibrosis
4. **Stage 4**: Liver Cirrhosis

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to determine the liver disease stage of a patient based on a variety of clinical and demographic features, which include both numerical and categorical data.

## Project Context

Cirrhosis represents an advanced stage of liver fibrosis caused by liver diseases such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. The dataset used in this project was collected during a Mayo Clinic study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) between 1974 and 1984. It includes information on 424 patients, with 312 participants in a randomized trial for the drug D-penicillamine and an additional 112 non-trial patients monitored for survival. This data was gathered to examine liver disease progression and survival rates.

This project draws from:

- *Counting Processes and Survival Analysis* by Fleming and Harrington (1991)
- Studies published in *Hepatology* and *New England Journal of Medicine* on PBC

## Dataset Description
